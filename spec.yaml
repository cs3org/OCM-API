        This endpoint returns a number of properties used to discover the capabilities
        offered by a remote cloud storage. The endpoint is named `/ocm-provider` owing
        to already established practices and constraints with the main cloud storages
        that implement OCM (see https://github.com/cs3org/OCM-API/pull/37#issuecomment-435875108

        Signal that this OCM provider has the capability to enforce MFA when accessing
        remote shares.
        A sender MAY set the permission `mfa-enforced` on a share to this provider:
        when a consumer attempts to access such a share, the consumer server SHOULD
        enforce, prior to access, that a session exists for the consumer and that
        it has been authenticated with MFA, or prompt the consumer in order to
        elevate their session to MFA if that is applicable.
        Note: there is no guarantee that the consumer service actually enforces any MFA
        requirements, so a trust must be established before relying on this capability.

        a trusted user.
        For example, a notification MAY be sent by a recipient to let the provider know
        that the recipient declined a share. In this case, the provider site MAY mark the
        share as declined for its user(s).
        Similarly, it MAY be sent by a provider to let the recipient know that the provider
        removed a given share, such that the recipient MAY clean it up from its database.
