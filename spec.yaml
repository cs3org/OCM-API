        Signal that this OCM provider has the capability to enforce MFA when accessing

        A sender MAY set the permission `mfa-enforced` on a share to this provider:
        when a consumer attempts to access such a share, the consumer server SHOULD
        enforce, prior to access, that a session exists for the consumer and that
        it has been authenticated with MFA, or prompt the consumer in order to
        elevate their session to MFA if that is applicable.
        Note: there is no guarantee that the consumer service actually enforces any MFA
        requirements, so a trust must be established before relying on this capability.

        Notifications are optional messages. They are expected to be used to inform the
        other party about a change about a previously known entity, such as a share or
        a trusted user.
        For example, a notification MAY be sent by a recipient to let the provider know
        that the recipient declined a share. In this case, the provider site MAY mark the
        share as declined for its user(s).
        Similarly, it MAY be sent by a provider to let the recipient know that the provider
        removed a given share, such that the recipient MAY clean it up from its database.
        A notification MAY also be sent to let a recipient know that the provider
        removed that recipient from the list of trusted users, along with any related share.
        The recipient MAY reciprocally remove that provider from the list of trusted users,
        along with any related share.

                this field may be removed in a future major version of the spec.

                    An optional secret to be used to access the resource,
                    such as a bearer token.
                    To prevent leaking it in logs it MUST NOT appear in any URI.

                      The permissions granted to the sharee.
                      - `read` allows read-only access including download of a copy.
                      - `write` allows create, update, and delete rights on the resource.
                      - `share` allows re-share rights on the resource.
                      - `mfa-enforced` requires the user accessing the resource to be
                        MFA-authenticated. This permission MAY be used if the
                        provider exposes the `mfa-capable` capability.

                  description: |
                    An URI to access the remote resource. The URI MAY be relative,
                    in which case the prefix exposed by the `/ocm-provider` endpoint MUST
                    be used, or it may be absolute (recommended). Additionally, the URI
                    MAY include a secret hash in the path, in which case there MAY be
                    no associated `sharedSecret`.

                  description: |
                    A templated URI to a client-browsable view of the shared resource,
                    such that users may use the web applications available at the site.
                    The URI MAY include a secret hash in the path. If the path includes
                    a `{relative-path-to-shared-resource}` placeholder, implementations
                    MAY replace it with the actual path to ease user interaction.

                    - `read` allows read and download access via the web app.
                    - `write` allows full editing rights via the web app.
                    - `mfa-enforced` requires the user accessing the resource to be
                      MFA-authenticated. This permission MAY be used if the
                      provider exposes the `mfa-capable` capability.
